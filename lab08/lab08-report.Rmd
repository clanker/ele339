# Introduction

This lab is an interesting introduction to MOSFET amplifiers.
We compose an emitter follower amplifier with a MOSFET pair current source
as a load. I did not have enough time to prototype the
circuit and measure the DC and AC characteristics.

# Design Procedure

Here are the calculated values for the biasing and
with $R_E = 5000 \Omega$:

Here are the calculated values for the biasing and current source topologies:

Note that these LTspice nmos4 madels all have $W = 10$ and $L=0.18$,
and simulations showed that $\beta_n = 1.111\, mA/V^2$,
because $\mu_n C_{ox}= 20\, \mu A/V^2$ (found with $W = L$).

# Small Signal Model

Here is the AC circuit model that has the same output response
as the full DC model:

# Voltage gain

The voltage gain is

$$\frac {v_{out}}{v_in} = \frac {g_m R_L}{1 + g_m R_L} = 
\frac {(0.000471)(1000)}{1 + (0.000471)(1000)} = \frac {0.471}{1.471} = 0.320$$

The LTspice simulation has the $v_{out}$ amplitude as 0.3197.
