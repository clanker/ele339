## Introduction

This lab explores basic diode circuits, culminating in
the two op-amp full-wave rectifier.
Extensive SPICE simulations supplement lab measurements.

## Figure 1 diode circuits

Here are commentaries and SPICE simulations for the three circuits
of Figure 1.

### Figure 1a: capped rectifier

A rectifier. My measurements were 7.55 V, meaning I need a better
op-amp to amplify my AFG output. SPICE simulation shown below in Figure \ref{fig:p1a}.
The diode passes current through to the capacitor and prevents
(essentially due to the reverse current so negligibly small)
the charge from draining. The output should be constant (within fractions
of a percent) about the value where the following equal:

1. charge lost from the capacitor
  a. leakage current within capacitor during 1 cycle
  b. reverse current through diode when its voltage is negative (likely dominated by the capacitor leakage current)
2. charge gained from the capacitor
  a. diode current due to a positive voltage difference (though only a small portion of the cycle when that occurs)
  
It would be interesting to explore these idea further when precise
measurement equipment.

### Figure 1b: signal shifter

This circuit demonstrates that voltage is potential. As the voltage increases to $V_{D, on}$ (turning on the diode) there is no current flow, so the capacitor voltage must be zero. When node `out` achieves a voltage sufficient to start current flow in the diode (at 10 $\mu$s), then the capacitor voltage increases according to the integral of current. Current flow stops at about 0.25 ms. See SPICE output in Figure \ref{fig:p1b}

![Figure 1b circuit response. A load of 220 $\Omega$ is connected at 2 ms. V(in, out) is the voltage across the capacitor. I show the two branch currents: the diode current in cyan and the load current in magenta.](p1b_220.pdf){#fig:p1b width=600 height=300}

Once the capacitor is charged, there is no way for it to lose charge as the diode prevents its discharge cycle when the voltage decreases. Therefore this circuit is a voltage shift of the input waveform. 

A resistive load completely changes this circuit as shown in the figure. Now the `out` node an lose its charge. I found a resistance of 10 k$\Omega$ didn't demonstrate the discharge behavior well enough so used a 220 $\Omega$ resistor. The resistor current is proportional to the $V_{out}$, so primarily current flows from ground to the `out` node. The diode activates to prevent `out` from exceeding 0.7 V, restoring the voltage shift.

It's also worthy to note what happens with the diode is flipped so current flows to the `out` node. See the following SPICE output in Figure \ref{fig:p1b2}. Now the voltage shift is positive between `out` and `in` as diode creates positive potential on the `out` node due to positive capacitor voltage. Nothing happens in the first half-cycle (0.5 ms) as the diode is off (except for the tiny reverse current) so there is no capacitor voltage.

A very interesting circuit with plenty to explore!

### Figure 1c: voltage doubler

Putting these circuits together results in a voltage doubling circuit.
The second circuit (1b, with diode inverted) acts as a voltage shifter but
we demonstrated can't hold voltage with a load.
This problem is corrected by appending the first circuit that feeds
charge/voltage to the `out` node and is stored on the capacitor for use by the load.
Appropriate selection of capacitor sizes is required based on
the resistance of the load.

From the SPICE output in Figure \ref{fig:p1c}, the 10 k$\Omega$ load (connected
at 20 ms) causes a voltage reduction at `out` along with an unsteady
level.

## Figure 2 diode clipping circuits

These circuits aren't interesting as their behavior is the same and obvious. SPICE output is provided in Figure \ref{fig:p2c} for the last circuit without commentary, other than 
stating that the order of Zener diodes doesn't matter (confirmed by SPICE, too).

![Figure 2c circuit response. The current flows through the Zener diodes when the absolute value of the voltage potential across the two diodes exceeds $V_{D, on} + V_{Breakdown}$. A 10 k$\Omega$ resistor is added after two cycles to see its effect on the circuit.](p2c.pdf){#fig:p2c width=600 height=300}

## Figure 3 two op-amp full-wave rectifier

Here is a fascinating circuit that takes forever to simulate in SPICE,
likely because my op-amp subcircuit is too complicated. The SPICE output
is given in Figure \ref{fig:p3}. My commentary follows.

![Figure 3 circuit response. Node `in` is the source $V_S$. The `swon` node is a switch that attaches a 10 k$\Omega$ load. Node `n1` is the anode of the diode whose cathode is at $V_1$.](p3.pdf){#fig:p3 width=600 height=300}

### First op-amp

$V_1$ is $V_s$ inverted, but the diode (whose anode is $V_1$)
prevents $V_1$ going above $V_{D, on}$. I'm not sure why $V_1$ achieves $-10.7 V$, possibly due to node `n1` needing a voltage of $-10 V$ when $V_S = 10 V$ because the
op-amp inputs must be at zero potential due to the non-inverting input
being connected to ground (using voltage division of the three nodes).
$V_1$ cannot go above $V_{D, on}$ due to the diode whose anode is at $V_1$,
so $V_1 = 0.7 V$ when $V_S$ is in its negative half-cycle.

Node `n1` is as expected given voltage division using $V_S$ and $V_{opamp1,in-}$ when $V_S$ is in its positive half-cycle as the op-amp output is driven negative, turning on the `ni` diode.
When this occurs the other diode connected to $V_1$ is off as the op-amp inputs are essentially at ground, so it's as if the opamp is connected at typical without the diodes. Node `n1`'s behavior changes when $V_S$
is in its negative half-cycle and the voltage $V_1$ increases.
Now the diode for node `n1` is off and all charge is shorted back to
the op-amp inputs. (I'll wait to learn more about op-amps to study
this behavior.) The result is that $V_1$ is stuck at 0.7 V. It's charge
depletion to its own input node must be why $n1$ goes to 0 V at this point,
but I'm sure.

### Second op-amp

Op-amp two is easier to understand as it's in a typical inverting
amplifier mode. The capacitor at $V_out$ stabilizes the charge.
We have to explore the inverting input to the op-amp though.
The inverting input is going to be one-third of the potential between
`n1` (which is always 0 when $V_S$ is negative and is $-V_S$ when $V_S$ is negative. So this means the inverting input is same during each of the
half-cycles and wants to achieve the following potential:

$$ - \tfrac {10} 3 |sin(wt)|$$

The input nodes are kept near zero due to the non-inverting input at
ground, so this is input signal that is amplified. I think
the circuit as presented is wrong, as the thinking was that the op-amp's input
resistance would be a Thevenin equivalent of $\tfrac 1 3 R$.
I don't think that is correct as the resistor between the inverting input
and $V_S$ sets voltage but doesn't factor in to the resistance
for the op-amp amplification. I think the input resistance is still
$\tfrac 1 2 R$ so accordingly I increased the other op-amp resistor to $\tfrac 3 2 R$
to achieve the needed 3x amplification. My modification does
achieve close to $10 V$ rectification, see Figure \ref{fig:p3mod}.

![Figure 3 circuit modification. Increasing the second opamp output-connecting resistor to $\tfrac 3 2 R$ boosts the rectified voltage to 10 V.](p3mod.pdf){#fig:p3mod width=600 height=300}
