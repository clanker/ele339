MacSpice/LTspice simulations and lab reports

## `labs`: ELE 339 Labs

In directory `labs` there is my work for
the labs of URI class ELE 339: Electronics I Lab.

A PDF compilation of all lab reports is in this directory.

## `projects`: Analysis projects

A collection of stand-alone projects, including:

* Filters: Analysis of Bode plots for all RC and RL filters, including series resistance for inductors. Interactive using R/Shiny.

## `reactance`: Plots of C and L reactance

Plotting code for capactior and inductor reactance
vs. frequency.

## `models`: SPICE models

A place for SPICE models for use in LTspice.

## `scratch`: Miscellaneous analyses

In directory `scratch` exist miscellaneous analyses, including:

* A white paper on faster convergence using Newton-Raphson to determine the diode voltage given a simple KVL loop. (`diode-v-nr.pdf`)

* Testing Common Emitter amplifier configurations for Lab 5 of ELE 339.

* A simulation of the amplifier in Problem 1 of ELE 338 Exam 2.
